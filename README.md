## Word to DITA
This conversion works best if you only use the default MS Word styles to semantically mark up your document.
 
The **Create DITA maps from Word documents containing multiple sections** option from the conversion dialog box allows you to decide whether the output will be a DITA map or a DITA topic.
When this option is selected, all sections from your Word document marked by titles or headings will be separated into individual DITA topics and referenced in a DITA map. If the word document does not contain multiple sections, the output will be a single topic.
When this option is not selected, the output will be a topic with nested topics or sections according to the number of sections from the Word document.

## Markdown to DITA
 
The **Create DITA maps from Markdown documents containing multiple headings** option from the conversion dialog box allows you to decide whether the output will be a DITA map or a DITA topic.
When this option is selected, all headings from your Markdown document will be separated into individual DITA topics and referenced in a DITA map. If the Markdown document does not contain multiple sections, the output will be a single topic.
When this option is not selected, the output will be a topic with nested topics or sections according to the number of headings from the document.

The **Create short description elements** option from the conversion dialog box allows you to decide if the **shortdesc** elements are created in the output DITA document. 
When this option is selected, the first paragraph before the headings from the Markdown document will be converted into DITA short description elements (**<shortdesc>**).
When this option is not selected, the  output will not contain the short description element.

## HTML to DITA
 
The **Create DITA maps from HTML documents containing multiple headings** option from the conversion dialog box allows you to decide whether the output will be a DITA map or a DITA topic.
When this option is selected, all headings from your HTML document will be separated into individual DITA topics and referenced in a DITA map. If the HTML document does not contain multiple sections, the output will be a single topic.
When this option is not selected, the output will be a topic with nested topics or sections according to the number of headings from the document.
